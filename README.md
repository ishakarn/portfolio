# Isha Karn – Portfolio

### 🎓 Education  
**M.S. in Computer Science**  
University of Massachusetts Amherst  
(Expected May 2026)

### 🔬 Research Interests  
- Machine Learning & AI Interpretability  
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)  
- Bioinformatics & Molecular Graph Analysis  
- Social Network Analysis  
- Misinformation and Fake News Detection

### 🧠 About Me  
I'm a graduate student passionate about using machine learning to solve real-world problems in science and society. My recent work explores how structural and feature-based signals affect GNN performance in fake news detection. I'm also beginning work on molecular property prediction using graph-based models in bioinformatics.

### 📌 Currently Working On  
- Analyzing the role of graph structure vs. node features in fake news detection (ICLR/AAAI submission in progress)  
- Exploring GNN-based molecular modeling for bioinformatics research  
- Learning about AI governance and ethical AI applications
